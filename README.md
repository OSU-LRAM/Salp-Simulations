# Salp-Simulations
Package of MatLab code that simulates and animates motion of salp-like swimmers.  These swimmers are chains of individual agents in a drag-dominated fluid environment that are elastically connected and move by exerting thrust into the fluid.

# How To Use

Make sure you have the dependencies installed: [sysplotter](https://github.com/OSU-LRAM/GeometricSystemPlotter) and [the MatLab gif Add-On](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/63239-gif).  Sysplotter needs to be initialized so that this code has access to Sysplotter's kinematics utilities.

For a basic example of a salp simulation run 'runQuickSimulation.m'

This file will process a basic simulation of a salp with listed options for varying simulation parameters
